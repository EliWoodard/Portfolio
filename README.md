# Eli Woodard's Portfolio Website

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the portfolio website. As a Computer Science major and an aspiring Software Engineer, I've created this website to showcase his projects, skills, and experiences.

The website is structured into different sections, including a header with a navigation bar, an 'About' section, and a 'Projects' section. It has a modern design with animations to improve user experience.
