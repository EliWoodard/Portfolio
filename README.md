# Eli Woodard's Portfolio Website

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the portfolio website. As a Computer Science major and an aspiring Software Engineer, I've created this website to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences.

My portfolio is split into 6 sections. The header required three.js with some complicated steps to get everything to match with dynamic web design. The contact section doesnt have any functinoality as the only interactive steps would be transfering a user to their email applciation.
